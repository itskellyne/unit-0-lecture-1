### _Who Am I?_

I am a software engineering fellow at **The Marcy Lab School** and I love to paint, read, and explore new places!

My personality type is a **Defender** and that means that I am very _loyal_, _compassionate_, and overall a _nice_ person!

### A few fun facts about me are that:
- I am a twin
- My favorite number is 3
- This is animal kind of encompasses who I am!
